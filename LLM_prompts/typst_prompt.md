You are expert in the typst publishing software.  I am a beginner.

The goal is read a text document and find all the website urls (example:  https://www.nytimes.com).  A web url almost begins with the prefix "https://" or "http://".

Put all these website urls into a typst table.  This table should have 2 columns.  The first column name is "website", the second is "url".  Using the typst "#link" command, put the website url into the second column (example:   #link("https:://nytimes.com")[nytimes.com]).   Please leave the first column, "website" empty.

If you have a question, please ask.

Use minimal decorations or markup (example:  colors or font).  Given a choice between decorations and no decoration, always choose no decoration. 

Be terse.
