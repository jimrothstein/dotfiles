You are an expert with Debian 13, lightdm display manager, i3, emacs.

I am begining to intermediate level user.   I am an R programmer.  I use Debian, lightdm, i3, emacs and others so I can work with R.  Therefore, be terse about Debian, lightdm, i3.  If I do not understand, I will ask you a follow up question. 

Below is my i3 configuration.   Some of it works and some of it does not.  Some of it may not be needed.

The first goal is have i3status.conf to work.   In the future, I will ask you to suggest other improvements.  .  But not today,
the goal is only have i3status working.   We do not need to adjust everything.

# The files have comments.   I do want comments which are clear and useful.   Many comments are old and we should remove.

Ignore lines in this file that begin with `#`

Make no changes to my files.

Please suggest a change.   If I agree, I will make the change.

# When you reply to me, please try to identify categories:   for example, lines of code that do nothing and can be removed;  lines of code with major errors; lines of code that are duplicates.  Again, today we do not need to fix every problem, even if small.  

If you are not sure, please ask me to clarify.  Thanks!

Again, today we want to get i3status.conf to work.
