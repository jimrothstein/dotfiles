! USAGE:   xmodmap .xmodmap

! ONE TIME TEST: > xmodmap -e "keycode 133 = Escape" 
!
! Procedure:   Run 'xev' and note carefully the CapsLock | Search keycode AND its keysym (in Ubuntu 'Super_L'), the  Escape keycode is 9 and its keysym is 'Escape'
!
! NOTE:   There is newer way, using kbx ?,  but this method method is fine for simple things.   See Archwiki Xmodmap

! This maps the control lock key to ESC  (for vim)
clear Lock

! in pure Chrome env, Chrome allows the META key (ie caps lock) to set to Escape key
!
!
! Forgot where is worked.
!keycode 0x42 = Escape

! Makes caps lock (keycode 133) behave like Escape (keycode 9)
! for Gallium | Ubuntu env
!keycode 133 = Escape

! Lenovo T480, linux mint;    actual `Esc` is 9;   actual `CapsLock` (66) now points to Escape
! keycode 9 = Escape
keycode 66 = Escape
